Racing wookies! A gambling ring for said wookie races. Need I say more?

##Backstory

This app was originally created to learn RSpec, Capybara, and FactoryGirl. So the heart of the application is just a boring Rails app with a couple of ugly crud screnes. However! Plans for improvement are afoot! I am now using this app to create a game where users can race as "wookies" (aka, walking carpets), bet on other games, and earn ficticious incomes based on gameplay and gambling. Fun times ahead!
